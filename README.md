## Indoor Bluetooth Localisation Using RSSI Fingerprinting
_You will implement an indoor WiFi/bluetooth localisation method based on RSSI fingerprinting. Wi-Fi fingerprinting creates a radio map of a given area based on the RSSI data from severalaccess points and generates a probability distribution of RSSI values for a given (x,y) location.Live RSSI values are then compared to the fingerprint to find the closest match and generate apredicted (x,y) location. You will evaluate such systems with real smart building deploymentsfacilitated by industrial partners._
